# cogworx-attr-scrub.service -- delete the previous boot's readiness and
# host-key guest attributes, as early as the metadata endpoint is reachable.
#
# Two properties are the entire point of this unit, and both are easy to lose
# by "tidying" the dependency graph:
#
#   1. It is NOT ordered on and NOT gated by cogworx-floor.service. The case
#      the per-start nonce alone does not close is a guest-internal reboot or
#      a provider automatic restart WITHIN the same start epoch that lands on a
#      boot whose floor check fails: the previous boot's attribute still
#      carries the current epoch's nonce, so Status would read Running off a
#      floorless boot. A scrub sequenced after the floor check would never run
#      to remove it. Independence is what deletes it anyway.
#
#   2. It retries forever (Restart=on-failure with StartLimitIntervalSec=0). A
#      failed scrub is a PENDING scrub, not a terminal state: the supervisor
#      Requires= it, so until it lands nothing re-stamps readiness over
#      unscrubbed state, and the residual window is bounded by the retry
#      cadence rather than open-ended. A start limit would convert that bounded
#      window into a permanent one.
#
#      RestartMode=direct is what makes property 2 actually hold, and it is not
#      a tuning knob. Under the default RestartMode=normal a unit transits
#      through failed/inactive on its way into auto-restart, and systemd cancels
#      the start job of anything that Requires= + After= it. `direct`
#      transitions straight into activating, so the dependent start job stays
#      queued across retries.
#
# It runs on every boot class, maintenance and resolver boots included.
