# Harnesses

A *harness* is a coding-agent CLI that cogbox installs in the guest and mounts host state for. The currently-supported harnesses are `claude-code` (launcher: `c`), `opencode` (launcher: `oc`), `omp` (launcher: `om`), `codex` (launcher: `cx`), `hermes-agent` (launcher: `h`), `dsh` (launcher: `ds`), and `pi` (launcher: `p`). OMP, Claude Code, opencode, Hermes, and dsh are enabled by default. Codex and pi are opt-in and disabled by default -- set `enableCodex = true` or `enablePi = true` in `flake.nix` to build them in. When a harness is not built in, its launcher, mounts, and host-state seeding are all omitted (the launcher's `HARNESSES` list is generated from the same `mkHarnesses` set).

## 2026-08 harness refresh

The shared `numtide/llm-agents.nix` input is pinned as one release unit so the VM and container images consume the same harness builds. The current pin carries claude-code `2.1.238`, opencode `1.18.19`, omp `17.4.0`, codex `0.149.0`, pi `0.84.2`, dsh `0.1.0-rc.7`, and Hermes source release `2026.8.18` (CLI `v0.20.4`) -- the bump that introduced dsh also refreshed all six existing harnesses. dsh is an upstream developer-preview release (`0.1.0-rc.x`): expect compatibility-breaking changes across bumps, which the release-gate version pins make explicit each time. Note Hermes moves on both axes independently, so the CLI string in the release gate is not derivable from the package version and has to be read off the built binary. Codex and pi are built and version-checked by the release gate but remain absent from default images while their enable flags are false.

The input deliberately does not set `inputs.nixpkgs.follows` (see the comment on it in `flake.nix`), because llm-agents publishes its builds to `cache.numtide.com` against its own pinned nixpkgs and overriding that would force a local rebuild of every harness. A cache miss is expensive: Hermes compiles a bun2nix frontend, and OMP compiles its TypeScript/Bun application plus a large Rust native addon. Bumping this input is therefore not reliably a lock-only change; budget for the rebuild.

Four upstream behaviours require local compatibility handling:

- `cogbox-brain-materialize` creates a `cron`, `sessions`, `logs`, `memories` skeleton under the Hermes home after persistent state is ready. `HERMES_MANAGED=nixos` is not set anywhere in this repo, so the skeleton is currently defensive rather than load-bearing. If that variable is enabled, the dependency needs its own validation. The VM requires the Hermes overlay mount before materialization; the container maps `/root/.hermes` to `/var/lib/cogbox-state/hermes-home` on the per-instance PVC. Container setup replaces only an empty image scaffold and fails closed on a nonempty directory, wrong symlink, or invalid persistent target rather than merging or deleting state.
- The updated pi package switched its installed executable from the npm/Node entrypoint to a Bun standalone. Cogbox retains pi source and version `0.82.1` but overrides the install phase to use the package's supported Node entrypoint, preserving the upstream `fd`/`ripgrep` helper path and telemetry/version-check settings. That override has not been validated against `0.82.1`: pi ships opt-out (`enablePi = false`), and the release gate version-checks the base numtide package. Anyone setting `enablePi = true` should confirm the Node entrypoint still exists upstream.
- Claude-code requires its first-run bypass-permissions consent before the `c` launcher can reach the REPL. Cogbox seeds the top-level `bypassPermissionsModeAccepted` key alongside `hasCompletedOnboarding` on both backends: the VM through `brainTrustScript`, and the container through both branches of `claudeStubScript`. Claude-code migrates the acceptance into `userSettings.skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` and removes the top-level key on first run, so a used config without `bypassPermissionsModeAccepted` is expected. `checks.harness-firstrun-flags` asserts all three seed sites. Bare `claude` remains in manual mode.
- The OMP package is a compiled Bun executable. On minimal Nix systems its OAuth token exchanges can fail certificate validation unless a CA bundle is explicit. Every cogbox launcher receives the assembled system plus per-instance L7 bundle through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/run/cogbox/ca-bundle.crt`; `om` therefore covers both normal provider traffic and every interactive login flow. Agent sessions also pass `--approval-mode yolo` explicitly so persisted host settings cannot reintroduce approval prompts. OMP's `auth-broker` parser rejects that launch-only flag, so `om auth-broker ...` retains the CA environment but omits the approval argument.

The release gate executes all seven package version paths, boots the full VM check, exercises Hermes managed-home initialization and overlay placement, verifies the OMP launcher and its flagless auth-management path, version-checks the opt-in pi package directly, and builds both harness-bearing OCI images from the same source tree.

## The harness model

The model is symmetric and opt-in:

- **All enabled harness binaries are always installed** in the guest, regardless of which host-state directories are active. Codex remains excluded unless enabled at build time.
- **Host state is created only for harnesses you actually use.** On first init, the wrapper checks for any pre-existing harness config on the host and treats those harnesses as active. If none are found, it prompts you to choose. The active list is recorded at `<datadir>/.config/active-harnesses`.
- **A single overlay image** (`harness-overlay.img`) backs persistent state for all harnesses, with per-harness subdirectories inside (`/var/lib/harness-rw/<harness>/<pathkey>/{upper,work}` and `/var/lib/harness-rw/<harness>/{cache,state}` for ephemeral paths). Resizing `overlaySize` covers all harnesses at once.

Host state shared across all instances:

| Harness | Host config | Host auth/data |
|---|---|---|
| claude-code | `~/.claude/` | `~/.claude.json` |
| opencode | `~/.config/opencode/` | `~/.local/share/opencode/` (includes `auth.json`) |
| codex | `~/.codex/` | `~/.codex/` (includes `auth.json`) |
| hermes-agent | `~/.hermes/` | `~/.hermes/` (includes `.env` with provider API keys) |
| pi | `~/.pi/` | `~/.pi/` (includes `agent/auth.json`) |
| omp | `~/.omp/` | `~/.omp/` (includes `agent/agent.db`, the SQLite credential store) |
| dsh | `~/.dsh/` | `~/.dsh/` (includes `.credentials.yaml` with provider API keys) |

Inside the guest, host config dirs are mounted read-only (9p) as overlay lowerdirs, with each instance's writes captured in its own overlay image -- so per-instance harness settings persist independently while authentication stays shared. Single-file auth tokens are injected at boot via `fw_cfg`.

> **Note on credentials in the sandbox.** Mounting the host's auth this way also exposes the harness's long-lived secrets (for the OAuth harnesses, the **refresh token** in `.credentials.json` / `auth.json`) to a potentially-compromised agent inside the VM. To keep those out of the sandbox, see [host-side credential injection](network-filtering.md#host-side-credential-injection): the terminate-tier proxy injects the real token host-side so the guest only carries a **redacted, still-logged-in placeholder** (present and scoped, not the real token). For claude-code you can also run `/login` **inside** the guest to use a different account -- that login persists in that instance only, and the guest stops inheriting the host token (clear it to resume inheritance). See [In-VM login](network-filtering.md#in-vm-login-per-instance-isolated).

To add a harness after init, either create its host config dir manually and re-launch, or set `COGBOX_<HARNESS>_<KEY>` to point at an existing dir (see [host-side path overrides](internals.md#host-side-path-overrides)).

A note about `node_modules/`: if a host harness config dir contains a `node_modules/` tree, it is exposed read-only into the VM via the 9p lowerdir share. To avoid streaming hundreds of megabytes through 9p on every boot, keep heavy package installs out of harness config dirs.

## Plugin kits per harness

Independently of the shared host config above, [plugins](plugins.md) contribute an agent-facing **kit** (skills/agents/commands/rules + merged MCP/settings) via the `cogbox.*` module options. The base materializes one neutral kit into each enabled harness's native layout under the project workdir `~/work` -- `.claude/`, `.opencode/`, omp's `.omp/`, the `.agents/skills/` tree shared by codex and pi, Hermes's `~/.hermes/skills/`, and a harness-neutral `AGENTS.md` rules digest (read by pi, Hermes, codex, and dsh; linked only-if-absent) -- so the same plugin serves every harness. OMP receives native project skills, agents, commands, rules, and MCP config. pi/Hermes gaps: no plugin MCP, settings, agent, or command mapping yet. dsh needs no per-harness kit block: it reads the shared workspace `AGENTS.md` digest natively (same gap tier as pi/Hermes -- no skills/MCP/settings mapping). Plugin *tools* reach every harness via the shared `PATH` prepend. This is project-scoped and per instance: Hermes's skill links land in the instance's overlay/PVC, never the host directory.

## How "full auto" is wired per harness

- `c` (claude-code) sets `IS_SANDBOX=1` and passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- `oc` (opencode) sets `OPENCODE_PERMISSION='{"edit":"allow","bash":"allow","webfetch":"allow","doom_loop":"allow","external_directory":"allow"}'`. Opencode `JSON.parse`s that env var and merges it into `config.permission`. Opencode 1.18.3 still requires the object form keyed by permission category (`edit`/`bash`/`webfetch`/`doom_loop`/`external_directory`, each `ask|allow|deny`; `bash` may also be a `{pattern: action}` map) -- the old bare-string shorthand `"allow"` is rejected with a fatal `ConfigInvalidError` (the schema indexes the string char-by-char: `Expected PermissionAction, got "a"`), which blocks startup. Setting every category to `allow` matches every tool/pattern so opencode never prompts. opencode's own `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag exists only on the `run` subcommand (one-shot mode) and is rejected by the default TUI command's strict yargs parser, so the env-var path is the universal bypass.
- `cx` (codex) sets `IS_SANDBOX=1` and passes `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, codex's documented escape hatch that skips all confirmation prompts and disables codex's own command sandbox. The outer microvm provides the actual sandbox.
- `h` (hermes-agent) sets `HERMES_YOLO_MODE=1`, which bypasses hermes's dangerous-command approval prompts. The env var is equivalent to the `--yolo` flag but covers every subcommand (chat, gateway, cron). Hermes's hardline blocklist (`rm -rf /`, fork bombs, disk formatting) stays active regardless -- it is a code-level constant, not a prompt.
- `om` (omp) passes `--approval-mode yolo`, which overrides persisted approval settings for the session. The launcher also sets `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to cogbox's assembled trust bundle; this is required for reliable OAuth with OMP's compiled Bun runtime on minimal Nix systems.
- `p` (pi) needs no flag or env var: pi has no built-in permission system at all (documented upstream), so it never prompts. The outer microvm is the only containment, same as the other harnesses.
- `ds` (dsh) sets `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE=danger-full-access`: dsh derives its sandbox-policy mode from that env var and derives approval `never` for that mode, so tools never prompt and dsh's own bwrap/Landlock runner is bypassed -- the outer microvm is the containment. The launcher also sets `DSH_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` (session telemetry ships disabled; hard opt-out). Sessions can still switch permission presets at runtime in the Web UI or via `/permission`.

### dsh Web UI

`ds --profile web` serves dsh's Web UI on the guest's loopback (`127.0.0.1:3080`; `--host 0.0.0.0` is deliberately rejected by the CLI). Reach it from the host with an SSH local forward: `ssh -i ~/.local/share/cogbox/cogbox_ed25519 -p <sshPort> -L 3080:127.0.0.1:3080 root@<bindAddr>`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:3080` (any editor auto-forward works too). Over SSH dsh suppresses its browser handoff on its own, so no flag is needed; on the VM console it tries to open a browser (harmless in the guest). Enter the DeepSeek API key in Settings → Models (stored in `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml`). CLI one-shots: `ds --profile headless "task"`.

## Adding a new harness

The architecture is harness-agnostic. Adding one means declaring its host paths (config/auth/data, each with a kind: `overlay`, `fw_cfg`, or `ephemeral`), launcher, and package in the `mkHarnesses` attrset in `flake.nix`, then adding the matching host-path metadata in `cogbox-launch.sh`. The launcher's `HARNESSES` list is generated from `mkHarnesses`; harness names double as 9p tags, fw_cfg keys, and runtime symlink names.
