#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Behavioural test for cogbox-enforce.sh, the SEPARATE enforcer pod's PID1
# supervisor. Its first-ever test: everything that matters in this file is an
# ORDERING or a REFUSAL that no static artifact (the unit file, the pod spec)
# can show, which is exactly why the auth-proxy third `wait -n` arm shipped
# invisible in review until this existed. What is covered:
#
#   - all THREE children (mitmdump, the auth proxy, l7proxy) are started, in the
#     order start_l7mitm -> publish_ca -> start_l7auth -> start_l7proxy;
#   - each of the three is restarted INDEPENDENTLY by the wait -n loop -- kill
#     one, and exactly that one respawns (a new pid) while the other two keep
#     theirs. The auth-proxy arm is the correctness obligation of the whole
#     change: omit it and the enforcer runs without the auth proxy after one
#     crash, so every migrated git provider fails closed with no self-heal;
#   - terminate() kills all THREE;
#   - COGBOX_L7_AUTH_PORT and COGBOX_L7_AUTH_HOSTS are passed to mitmdump EVEN
#     WHEN the l7-auth-hosts file does not exist -- the :93-102 bug re-asserted
#     for the new vars (blanking a runtime path wedges the addon reader);
#   - the supervisor never writes a PID into $RUNTIME/authproxy.pid, but does
#     PRE-CREATE it EMPTY on every (re)start, mirroring the VM launcher. That
#     file is the auth proxy's v1 health signal, whose contents the Zig side
#     writes only after its listener bound and its first conf parse succeeded;
#     a pid the script wrote from $! would name a process that may already have
#     died on a bind failure. The cogbox stub here never writes it, so a
#     non-empty file at any point would prove the script did -- and a restart
#     must truncate a stale pid away rather than leave it to be read as live.
#
# Usage: test_enforce.sh <path-to-cogbox-enforce.sh>
# Needs: bash, coreutils, gawk, gnugrep. NOT cogbox/mitmproxy -- both are stubs.
